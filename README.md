# Introduction
When you step into ChainPray, this unique blockchain prayer platform, you will discover **a world full of warmth and care**. Unlike those projects solely focused on wealth and profits, ChainPray chooses to turn its attention to ordinary users in the cryptocurrency community who have been affected by hackers, bad actors, and liquidations, providing them with heartfelt spiritual support to make them feel truly cared for and supported.

ChainPray ingeniously blends traditional prayers with advanced blockchain technology. On this magical platform, every user has the right to **claim one "PrayLuck" (PrayLuck Coin) for free every day**. By activating the daily prayer feature, users receive blessings from the blockchain, starting their day with positivity and goodness. This precious gift allows you to feel the platform's thoughtfulness and care.

In addition, ChainPray offers many exciting and meaningful additional features, such as "**Destiny Pray**", "**GoodMan Contributions**", "**God Competitions**", and "**Sunny Award**". These features not only add fun but also make you experience the colorful and wonderful aspects of life.

# Token Pass System
ChainPray's token economy consists of two tokens, **PrayLuck** and **PrayLuckStar**, along with the issuance of **NFTs** with different attributes. PrayLuckStar is obtained by users through the probability of "Destiny Pray", and the more times users pray, the more accumulated luck they have, making it easier to obtain PrayLuckStar. ChainPray also releases NFTs with various attributes to help users acquire PrayLuckStar more easily. For detailed information, please refer to the TokenPlan section on the [ChainPray official website](https://chainpray.com).

# Profit and Rewards
ChainPray's mission is not limited to providing spiritual support to cryptocurrency users. During the project's operation, **DAO will regularly distribute the "Sunny Award" of PrayLuck to random ChainPray users**. This portion of PrayLuck comes entirely from users' prayer consumption, reflecting a concept of "**taking from the people, giving back to the people.**" In the later stages of the ChainPray project, PrayLuckStar obtained through Destiny Prayers will have various consumer use cases, such as purchasing advertising space on ChainPray, issuing chain-wide announcements, buying unique NFTs, and more. Therefore, ChainPray will generate profits, and **the DAO will continue to use a significant portion of the profits to carry out "Sunny Award" for random ChainPray users**.
